         <h2>Local Woman Wins Marathon</h2>
         <p><img src="blake.jpg" alt="" /> Estes Park native Laura Blake won the 27th 
            Front Range Marathon over an elite field 
            of the best long-distance  runners in the 
            country. Laura's time of 2 hr. 28 min. 21 sec. 
            was only 2 minutes off the women's course  
            record set last year by Sarah Rawlings. Kathy 
            Lasker and Lisa Peterson finished second and 
            third,  respectively. Laura's victory came on 
            the heels of her performance at the NCAA Track 
            and Field  Championships, in which she placed 
            second running for Colorado State. </p>
         <p>In an exciting race, Peter Teagan of San Antonio, 
            Texas, used a finishing kick to win the men's 
            marathon for  the second straight year, in a time 
            of 2 hr. 12 min. 34 sec. Ahead for much of the 
            race, Kyle Wills of  Billings, Montana, finished 
            second when he could not match Teagan's finishing 
            pace. Jason Wu of Boulder,  Colorado, placed third 
            in a very competitive field. </p>
         <p>This year's race through downtown Boulder boasted 
            the largest field in the marathon's history, with 
            over  9500 men and 6700 women competing. Race 
            conditions were perfect with low humidity and 
            temperatures that  never exceeded 85 degrees. </p>

         <h2>Highway 7 Reopens</h2>
         <p>Highway 7 will reopen this Friday, June 3rd, after 
            a final safety inspection. A late blizzard delayed 
            road crews, marking this as one of the latest dates 
            on record for the highway's reopening. </p>
         <p>Rising to an elevation of over 12,000 feet, 
            Highway 7 is a main link between Estes Park and Grand
            Lake. The reopening of the road is one of the annual 
            signs that summer is near and the tourist season will 
            soon be upon us! </p>

         <h2>Cougar Sightings <br/>
            Increase</h2>
         <p>Cougar sightings have increased 40% in the Estes Park 
            area according to a report released yesterday by 
            the state DNR. In the last month alone, there were 
            ten sightings in Estes Park and the surrounding 
            communities of Grand Lake and Pinewood Springs. This compares to 
            only twelve sightings for the entire spring of 
            last year. </p>
         <p>Reasons for the growing number of cougar sightings 
            include increasing encroachment by people into 
            former wildlife habitats and new wildlife 
            regulations that result in decreasing numbers of 
            elk and deer being taken by hunters. Cougars may 
            be wandering into developed areas, following 
            the herds. </p>
         <p>DNR spokesman Steve Tasker asks residents to call 
            the DNR report line at 555-6981 if they believe they 
            have seen a cougar or any large predatory animal. 
            Two fatalities have already occurred in the west 
            this year from cougar attacks. </p>

            <h2>If You Encounter a Cougar</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>Stop, stand tall, and don't run. A cougar's 
                  instinct is to chase. </li>
               <li>Try to appear larger than the cougar by 
                  raising your arms. </li>
               <li>Back away slowly, always keeping eye contact. </li>
               <li>If the cougar displays aggressive behavior, 
                  shout and wave your arms. Convince the cougar 
                  that you are not prey, but a potential danger. </li>
               <li>In case of an attack, stay on your feet and 
                  fight back aggressively. </li>
            </ul>
